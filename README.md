# Airbnb Clone Project

---

## About the Project 
The **Airbnb Clone Project** is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform similar to Airbnb. This project offers a deep dive into full-stack development, with a strong focus on backend systems, database design, API development, and application security. It aims to provide learners with hands-on experience in understanding complex architectures, workflows, and collaborative team dynamics while building a scalable web application.

## Project Goals
 - **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
 - **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
 - **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
 - **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
 - **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
 - **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

##  Technology Stack
 - **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
 - **Django REST Framework**: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
 - **PostgreSQL**: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
 - **GraphQL**: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
 - **Celery**: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
 - **Redis**: Used for caching and session management.
 - **Docker**: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
 - **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.

## Team Roles
This project leverages a collaborative team structure, with each role playing a crucial part in the successful delivery of the Airbnb Clone backend:

* **Backend Developer:**
    * **Responsibilities:** Responsible for designing, implementing, and maintaining the core logic of the application. This includes developing API endpoints (using Django and Django REST Framework), integrating with the database (PostgreSQL), implementing business logic for user, property, booking, payment, and review management, and ensuring the overall performance and scalability of the backend services. They also work with GraphQL for flexible data querying and integrate asynchronous tasks with Celery.
* **Database Administrator (DBA):**
    * **Responsibilities:** Focused on the design, implementation, and maintenance of the PostgreSQL database. Key tasks include creating efficient database schemas, implementing indexing strategies for data optimization, managing data integrity, ensuring data security, and planning caching mechanisms using Redis to improve performance and reduce database load.
* **DevOps Engineer:**
    * **Responsibilities:** Manages the development and deployment pipeline. This includes setting up and maintaining the CI/CD pipelines (e.g., using GitHub Actions), containerizing applications with Docker for consistent environments, automating testing and deployment processes, monitoring system performance, and ensuring the scalability and reliability of the backend services in production.
* **QA Engineer (Quality Assurance Engineer):**
    * **Responsibilities:** Ensures the overall quality and reliability of the backend system. This involves designing and executing test plans, creating automated tests for API endpoints (REST and GraphQL), identifying and documenting bugs, verifying bug fixes, and collaborating closely with backend developers to ensure that all functionalities meet the defined requirements and quality standards.
