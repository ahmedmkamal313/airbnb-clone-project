## Technology Stack
* **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for rapidly building the robust and scalable backend for the RESTful API and overall application logic.
* **Django REST Framework**: Provides a powerful and flexible toolkit built on Django for creating and managing comprehensive RESTful APIs, facilitating CRUD operations for various project entities like users, properties, and bookings.
* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for reliable and efficient data storage. It's chosen for its robustness, extensibility, and support for complex queries, making it ideal for managing diverse datasets like user profiles, property listings, and booking details.
* **GraphQL**: An API query language and runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. It offers a flexible and efficient alternative to REST, allowing clients to request precisely the data they need, thereby optimizing data retrieval and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.
* **Celery**: A distributed task queue system used for handling asynchronous tasks. It enables offloading time-consuming operations (like sending notifications, processing payments, or generating reports) from the main request-response cycle, improving application responsiveness and user experience.
* **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. In this project, it's primarily used for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times, as well as for managing sessions and facilitating Celery's task queue.
* **Docker**: A platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. It ensures a consistent development, testing, and production environment by packaging the application and all its dependencies, simplifying deployment and minimizing "it works on my machine" issues.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows (e.g., implemented via GitHub Actions) for continuous integration and continuous deployment. These pipelines automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring higher code quality, faster release cycles, and reduced manual errors.

* **Users**
    * **Fields:** `user_id` (Primary Key), `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `registration_date`.
    * **Description:** Stores user information. Users can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.
* **Properties**
    * **Fields:** `property_id` (Primary Key), `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`.
    * **Description:** Stores property details. Each property is listed by one user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.
* **Bookings**
    * **Fields:** `booking_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key), `property_id` (Foreign Key), `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`.
    * **Description:** Records booking information. Each booking belongs to one user and one property.
* **Reviews**
    * **Fields:** `review_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key), `property_id` (Foreign Key), `rating`, `comment`.
    * **Description:** Stores reviews for properties. Each review is written by one user for one property.
* **Payments**
    * **Fields:** `payment_id` (Primary Key), `booking_id` (Foreign Key), `payment_date`, `amount`, `payment_method`.
    * **Description:** Manages payment records. Each payment is associated with one booking.

**Relationships:**

* **One-to-Many:**
    * A user can have multiple properties (User ⟷ Properties).
    * A user can make multiple bookings (User ⟷ Bookings).
    * A property can have multiple bookings (Property ⟷ Bookings).
    * A property can have multiple reviews (Property ⟷ Reviews).
* **One-to-One:**
    * A payment is associated with one booking (Payment ⟷ Booking).
 
## Feature Breakdown
This section outlines the primary features implemented in the Airbnb Clone backend, detailing their role in delivering a robust and functional booking platform:

* **API Documentation:**
    * Utilizes the OpenAPI standard for REST APIs and provides a GraphQL endpoint. This ensures clear, comprehensive documentation, making it easy for frontend developers or other services to understand and integrate with the backend's functionalities.
* **User Management:**
    * Encompasses secure user registration, authentication (login/logout), and profile management functionalities. This feature is fundamental for enabling users to interact with the platform, whether as hosts listing properties or guests making bookings.
* **Property Management:**
    * Allows users to create, view, update, and delete property listings. It is crucial for hosts to effectively manage their properties and for guests to browse and discover available accommodations.
* **Booking System:**
    * Provides the core mechanism for users to reserve properties, manage their booking details (like check-in/check-out dates), and view booking history. This feature simulates the central transaction process of a booking platform.
* **Payment Processing:**
    * Handles secure transactions related to bookings, including payment initiation and recording payment details. This is vital for monetizing the platform and ensuring secure financial operations between guests and hosts.

    * Involves implementing strategies like indexing and caching (with Redis) to ensure efficient data retrieval and storage. These optimizations are critical for maintaining high performance and responsiveness as the application scales with more users and data.
 
## API Security Overview
Securing the backend APIs is paramount for protecting sensitive data, maintaining user trust, and ensuring the integrity of the Airbnb Clone platform. Several key security measures will be implemented:

* **Authentication:**
    * **Measure:** Users will be required to authenticate their identity (e.g., via token-based authentication like JWT or OAuth 2.0). This ensures that only legitimate and verified users can access protected resources and perform actions specific to their roles.
    * **Crucial for:** Protecting user accounts from unauthorized access, preventing impersonation, and safeguarding personal information and credentials.
* **Authorization:**
    * **Measure:** Granular access controls will be implemented to define what authenticated users are allowed to do. For instance, a user can only update their own profile or property listings, and only administrators might have access to certain system-wide functionalities.
    * **Crucial for:** Ensuring data privacy (e.g., a guest cannot view another guest's booking details), maintaining data integrity (preventing unauthorized modifications to properties or bookings), and enforcing business rules.
* **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Measure:** API endpoints will have rate limits to restrict the number of requests a user or IP address can make within a specific timeframe.
    * **Crucial for:** Mitigating Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, preventing brute-force login attempts, and ensuring fair usage of API resources across all users.
* **Data Encryption:**
    * **Measure:** Sensitive data, especially user credentials (passwords) and payment information, will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/SSL/TLS) and at rest within the database.
    * **Crucial for:** Preventing eavesdropping during data transmission and protecting sensitive financial and personal data from breaches if the database is compromised.
* **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    * **Measure:** All user inputs received via API requests will be rigorously validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
    * **Crucial for:** Preventing SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and other code injection attacks that could compromise the database or the application's integrity.
* **Secure Error Handling:**
    * **Measure:** Error messages will be generic and not expose sensitive system information (e.g., stack traces, database details) to the client.
    * **Crucial for:** Preventing attackers from gathering information about the backend infrastructure and vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

By implementing these measures, the API security aims to create a robust defense against common threats, ensuring a secure and trustworthy platform for all users and their data.
