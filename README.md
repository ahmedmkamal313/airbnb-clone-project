## Project Goals 🎯
* **User Management**: Implement secure user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* **Property Management**: Develop features for listing, updating, and retrieving property details.
* **Booking System**: Create a mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage bookings.
* **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system for transactions and record keeping.
* **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database enhancements.

## Technology Stack 🛠️
* **Django**: 🐍 High-level Python web framework for building the robust RESTful API and core application logic.
* **Django REST Framework**: 🏗️ Toolkit for creating powerful RESTful APIs, enabling seamless CRUD operations.
* **PostgreSQL**: 🐘 Robust relational database for reliable and efficient data storage of all project entities.
* **GraphQL**: 🤝 API query language offering flexible and efficient data retrieval, minimizing over/under-fetching.
* **Celery**: ⏱️ Distributed task queue for handling asynchronous operations like notifications and payment processing, improving responsiveness.
* **Redis**: ⚡ In-memory data store used for caching and session management, boosting performance and reducing database load.
* **Docker**: 🐳 Containerization tool ensuring consistent development, testing, and production environments.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: ⚙️ Automated workflows (e.g., GitHub Actions) for continuous integration and deployment, ensuring quality and rapid releases.

## Team Roles 👥
This project fosters a collaborative team environment, with each role contributing to the backend's success:

* **Backend Developer:** 💻 Designs, implements, and maintains the core application logic, API endpoints, and database integrations.
* **Database Administrator (DBA):** 📊 Manages database schema design, indexing, security, and optimization strategies like caching.
* **DevOps Engineer:** ☁️ Sets up and maintains CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker), deployment automation, and system monitoring.
* **QA Engineer (Quality Assurance Engineer):** 🧪 Designs and executes test plans, automates API tests, and ensures overall backend quality and bug resolution.

## Database Design 🗄️
The database efficiently manages core entities and their relationships:

* **Users** 👤
    * **Fields:** `user_id` (PK), `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `registration_date`.
    * **Description:** Stores user information. Users can list properties and make bookings.
* **Properties** 🏠
    * **Fields:** `property_id` (PK), `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`.
    * **Description:** Details of properties listed by users, with multiple bookings and reviews.
* **Bookings** 🗓️
    * **Fields:** `booking_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK), `property_id` (FK), `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`.
    * **Description:** Records bookings, linking a user to a specific property.
* **Reviews** ⭐
    * **Fields:** `review_id` (PK), `user_id` (FK), `property_id` (FK), `rating`, `comment`.
    * **Description:** Stores user reviews for properties.
* **Payments** 💳
    * **Fields:** `payment_id` (PK), `booking_id` (FK), `payment_date`, `amount`, `payment_method`.
    * **Description:** Manages payment records, linked to specific bookings.

**Relationships:**
* **One-to-Many:** A user can have multiple properties/bookings. A property can have multiple bookings/reviews.
* **One-to-One:** A payment is linked to a single booking.

## API Security Overview 🛡️
Securing APIs is crucial for protecting sensitive data and user trust. Key measures include:

* **Authentication:** 🔑 Verifying user identity (e.g., token-based) to grant access to protected resources. Crucial for protecting accounts and preventing impersonation.
* **Authorization:** ✅ Defining what authenticated users can do with granular access controls. Essential for data privacy, integrity, and enforcing business rules.
* **Rate Limiting:** ⛔ Restricting API request frequency to prevent DoS attacks and ensure fair resource usage.
* **Data Encryption:** 🔒 Encrypting sensitive data (passwords, payments) both in transit (HTTPS) and at rest. Vital for protecting financial and personal information.
* **Input Validation & Sanitization:** 📝 Rigorously validating all user inputs to prevent injection and scripting attacks.
* **Secure Error Handling:** 🚫 Providing generic error messages to avoid exposing sensitive system information to attackers.

These measures build a robust defense against threats, ensuring a secure and trustworthy platform.
