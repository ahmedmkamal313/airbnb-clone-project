## Project Goals
* **User Management**: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
* **Property Management**: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
* **Booking System**: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
* **Payment Processing**: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
* **Review System**: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
* **Data Optimization**: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.

## Technology Stack
* **Django**: A high-level Python web framework used for rapidly building the robust and scalable backend for the RESTful API and overall application logic.
* **Django REST Framework**: Provides a powerful and flexible toolkit built on Django for creating and managing comprehensive RESTful APIs, facilitating CRUD operations for various project entities like users, properties, and bookings.
* **PostgreSQL**: A powerful, open-source relational database system used for reliable and efficient data storage. It's chosen for its robustness, extensibility, and support for complex queries, making it ideal for managing diverse datasets like user profiles, property listings, and booking details.
* **GraphQL**: An API query language and runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. It offers a flexible and efficient alternative to REST, allowing clients to request precisely the data they need, thereby optimizing data retrieval and reducing over-fetching or under-fetching.
* **Celery**: A distributed task queue system used for handling asynchronous tasks. It enables offloading time-consuming operations (like sending notifications, processing payments, or generating reports) from the main request-response cycle, improving application responsiveness and user experience.
* **Redis**: An in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker. In this project, it's primarily used for caching frequently accessed data to reduce database load and improve response times, as well as for managing sessions and facilitating Celery's task queue.
* **Docker**: A platform that uses OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. It ensures a consistent development, testing, and production environment by packaging the application and all its dependencies, simplifying deployment and minimizing "it works on my machine" issues.
* **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated workflows (e.g., implemented via GitHub Actions) for continuous integration and continuous deployment. These pipelines automate the processes of building, testing, and deploying code changes, ensuring higher code quality, faster release cycles, and reduced manual errors.

## Database Design
The database is structured to efficiently manage the core entities of the Airbnb Clone application. Key entities and their relationships are outlined below:

* **Users**
    * **Fields:** `user_id` (Primary Key), `username`, `email`, `password_hash`, `registration_date`.
    * **Description:** Stores user information. Users can list multiple properties and make multiple bookings.
* **Properties**
    * **Fields:** `property_id` (Primary Key), `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`.
    * **Description:** Stores property details. Each property is listed by one user and can have multiple bookings and reviews.
* **Bookings**
    * **Fields:** `booking_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key), `property_id` (Foreign Key), `check_in_date`, `check_out_date`.
    * **Description:** Records booking information. Each booking belongs to one user and one property.
* **Reviews**
    * **Fields:** `review_id` (Primary Key), `user_id` (Foreign Key), `property_id` (Foreign Key), `rating`, `comment`.
    * **Description:** Stores reviews for properties. Each review is written by one user for one property.
* **Payments**
    * **Fields:** `payment_id` (Primary Key), `booking_id` (Foreign Key), `payment_date`, `amount`, `payment_method`.
    * **Description:** Manages payment records. Each payment is associated with one booking.

**Relationships:**

* **One-to-Many:**
    * A user can have multiple properties (User ⟷ Properties).
    * A user can make multiple bookings (User ⟷ Bookings).
    * A property can have multiple bookings (Property ⟷ Bookings).
    * A property can have multiple reviews (Property ⟷ Reviews).
* **One-to-One:**
    * A payment is associated with one booking (Payment ⟷ Booking).
